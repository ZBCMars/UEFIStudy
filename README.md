# UEFIStudy
Here is the code I wrote in the process of learning UEFI. My goal is to write a complete OS Loader to boot the operating system in the U disk.

At present, there is a preliminary graphical interactive interface for booting, and a simple elf file with input can be started. The next goal is to improve the interface and increase the functionality of the operating system.

Current OS development progress:
* Interface for Shell
* Can print single letter
** Can print string, HEX and DEC number

This is the source code under UEFI specification and EDK2.
